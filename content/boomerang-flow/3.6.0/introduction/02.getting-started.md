# Getting Started

After gaining access, users will be presented with the Personal Workflows screen. This is your sandbox and allows you to create workflows, as long as you are within your quotas.

You can start creating Personal Workflows using the **Create a new Workflow** tile on the Workflows screen. This opens a modal that allows you to **Start from scratch** or **Import a Workflow**.

## Workflow Templates

You can also click the **Templates** button in the top right and create a workflow from Template. This is a great way to get started with proven workflows.

## Team Creation

Teams can be created in two ways:

1. By a user with Administrator rights, who can then map users to a team.
2. Through the APIs

> When integrated with IBM Consulting<sup>®</sup> Essentials, Boomerang Flow integrates with your Essentials teams. Ensure you have access to a team or create a new team and request access to Boomerang Flow.
