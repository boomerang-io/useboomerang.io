# Administer

> **Note:** the Administer part of Flow is restricted to administrators.

## Teams

Create and manage your teams. It provides an overview table for a high level snapshot of all Teams. You can then deep dive into each Team, its Users, its Workflows, and associated Settings.

## Users

View your Users and manage their role. It provides an overview table for a high level snapshot of all Users. You can then open an information modal through the overflow menu for each User or change their role.

## Global Parameters

Global parameters are one of the scopes of the parameter layering available. The Global Parameter administration screen allows you to create, edit, and delete Global parameters. For more information, see [Getting to Know Parameters](/docs/boomerang-flow/getting-to-know/parameters).

## Global Tokens

Global Tokens is where you can create and remove global scoped API tokens that allow you to perform actions against the API endpoints on behalf of the whole platform.

To understand more about scopes, see [Security Architecture](/docs/boomerang-flow/architecture/security).

To understand more about the APIs, see [API Architecture](/docs/boomerang-flow/architecture/apis).

### Viewing tasks

The left panel displays the currently defined tasks by category. Expand each category to view its related tasks.  

### Task header

The top of each task definition presents task version control. The name of the task, along with the date the task was last updated is displayed.

The **Version** control in the task header allows you to cycle through past versions of the task. When viewing the current version, **Reset changes** can be used to reset any editing you have done. When viewing a previous version, the parameters from that version can be copied into a new version using **Copy to new version**.

It also allows you to switch from Overview to YAML view. The YAML view supports the [Tekton Task definition](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/).

### Task definition

Task definition is split into: **Basics**, **Definition fields**, and **Result Parameters**

#### Basics

The following fields are defined as **Basics**.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The identifier for task, used throughout the platform. |
| **Category** | The group in the left task panel that is identified with the task.|
| **Icon** | The icon associated with that task, used throughout the platform.|
| **Description** | A short narrative of the task. |
| **Image** | The container image to use |
| **Command** | The command to run when starting the container |
| **Arguments** | The list of values passed into the task parameters. |

| **Working Directory** | The directory inside the container to execute inside of |
| **Envs** | Environment key values to define and pass through to the container |
| **Contribution level** | Verified or Community |

Definition fields vary according to the task. See [Parameters](/boomerang-cicd/getting-to-know/parameters).
The displayed fields can be dragged and dropped to change their order.
