| Number of Workflows | Number of Workflows that can be created for this team. | 10 | 10 |
| Number of Executions  | Number of executions per month across all Workflows for this Team | 100 per month | 100 per month |
| Concurrent Workflows | Max number of Workflows able to run at the same time. | 4 Workflows | 4 Workflows |
| Storage Size Capacity | The maximum number of workspace storage that can be created | 5GB per Workflow | 5GB per Workflow |
| Execution Time | Maximum amount of time that a single Workflow can take for one execution. | 30 minutes per Workflow | 30 minutes per Workflow |
