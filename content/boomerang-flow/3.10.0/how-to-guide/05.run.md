# Execute

To manually execute a Workflow, click **Run It** on the Workflow tile.

An Execute Workflow modal displays with two options. You can **Run** the Workflow and remain on the current Workflows page, or **Run and View** the Workflow, which takes you through to the detailed Activity Run screen, where you can view the Workflow progress.
